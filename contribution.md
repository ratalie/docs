# Contributing to Vaccine-Passport

We love your participation! This idea only works when we own it as a community and build the best possible. To achieve this, we want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Raising a concern
- Looking at compliance
- Adding language support
- Becoming a maintainer

## Community Guidelines

This is an open community designed to create an opportunity to solve a problem made apparent by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Please treat all community members with respect and help build a positive environment. As developers, we are all continually learning; we welcome all contributions, and offer feedback freely. Finally - no trolls, also, please don't feed the tolls. Trolls will simply get banned.

### Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. Discussion is open for the team team via Slack.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests - focus on testing behaviors; test coverage is important, intent coverage more-so.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Raise your pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD-3 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD-3 License](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github issues

Unless your issue is security related, we use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

For a **security** related issue, please submit your issue via [hawkpost](https://hawkpost.co/box/7b090289-7d98-41b5-ab53-91ffe0019588) which will generate a GPG encrypted message and include your contact information. If you're comfortable with GPG, feel free to use a maintainers' public key and send your report. All security issues are given highest consideration.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example from Bryan Danielak](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report as a good model and [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408) which is also very well done.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [Bryan's stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that _anyone_ with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports they are much better than "this isn't working - please help".

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Each component meets a purpose, but none are prescribed for what language solves the problem. Please follow the language's best practice and raise an issue if you'd like to see one of these practices changes from something already established. Also, please expect the repo to include configuration for linting and run that check, the CI/CD will be doing the same :)
